Disclaimer: this script was written by ChatGPT. I have no knowledge of python.

OcrQuestion is a small script that, when run, prefixes all pdfs found in the same folder as the script that have no text layer with "ocr_pending_". A .txt file  is generated at the end indicating any errors that took place in the process.

It does not perform its task on all subfolders.
